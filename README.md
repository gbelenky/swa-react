# React Basic with staging deployment

This sample shows how implement a GitHub Workflow for building a React build artifact separately and how to deploy the same build artifact to the Azure Static Web App through different stages/environments and with manual approvals.

This sample was created because most of the generated sample workflows for Azure Static Web Apps would build code each time they deploy it to the different environments what might cause an inconsistency in case of changing dependencies.
